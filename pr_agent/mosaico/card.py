"""Builds the MOSAICO A2A agent card for pr-agent.

The observability extension is advertised as required=True because the AISP spec says so
("AISP-specific extension: observability metadata ... Required: true" in the demonstrator's
docs/agent-requirements.md). Do NOT relax it to match the peer agents: docstring-agent
advertises required=False, ip-solution-agent and mini-swe-agent omit the flag entirely, and
the reference agent's own card omits it too, but they are the ones out of spec.

Streaming is advertised as False, which is load-bearing: the reference agent selects
message/send vs message/stream from capabilities.streaming."""
