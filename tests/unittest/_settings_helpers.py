"""Test-only helpers for snapshotting/restoring Dynaconf settings.

Dynaconf's ``settings.unset(key, force=True)`` does not reliably remove a
dotted leaf (e.g. ``"openai.deployment_id"``) after that leaf was created
via ``settings.set(...)``. The leaf survives inside the parent section's
``DynaBox``, which causes state to leak between tests that share the global
settings singleton.

These helpers provide a SENTINEL-based snapshot so that keys which were
originally absent are truly removed (not just rewritten to ``None``) during
restore, including for dotted keys.
