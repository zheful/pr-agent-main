"""HTTP /health route tests.

Uses Starlette TestClient against build_app(); monkeypatches health_check (the no-retry
behavior itself was proven in 2c). Verifies the route + 200/503 response shape.

Also exercises the REAL health_check() (no stub) to lock in Fix A: the removed
'stop'-param gate must NOT short-circuit /health for models that lack 'stop' (e.g. the
shipped gpt-5.x defaults), since PR-Agent's LiteLLMAIHandler never sends 'stop'."""
